# NBA Spread Prediction App

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts whether an NBA team will cover the point spread in a given game. It uses a Random Forest classifier trained on historical NBA betting data and is served through a Flask web interface.

## Project Overview

Users can input basic game-level betting information such as:

- Point Spread
- Moneyline
- Over/Under Total

Based on the trained model, the app predicts whether the team is likely to cover the spread.

The web app is built with Flask and styled using custom HTML/CSS. It is designed to be simple, fast, and extendable.

## Features

- Predict spread coverage using a trained Random Forest model
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Custom CSS styling for a clean layout
- Fully functional on localhost
- Easily deployable to platforms like Render or Railway

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development)
